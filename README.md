## What is UrsaMU?
**UrsaMU** is a **modern implementation** of the **MUSH** style internet talker, built on the shoulders of some great developers. As it's name might imply, the commands have a mush feel to them.  However, every **command**, and every **softcode function** can be customized to fit your game!

## Stay Tuned!
This project is still very much in it's infancy.  Please feel free to check back in later! As the API starts to solidify, documentation will follow. If you'd like to help with Ursa's development, please drop a line! There's much work that needs to be done still. :)
