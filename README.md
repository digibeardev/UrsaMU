## What is UrsaMU?
**UrsaMU** is a **modern implementation** of the **MUSH** style internet talker. This project is part exploration, and part nostalgia. Honestly, it's just a test to see how easy (or difficult) It would be to reproduce the parts I liked about using the MUSH format, and adding the features I wish it had years ago.

## Stay Tuned!
This project is still very much in it's infancy.  Please feel free to check back in later! As the API starts to solidify, documentation will follow.

**Feel free to poke around** and take a look at what I'm doing.  I wouldn't honestly suggest cloning the repo to try yet, it's far from done.
