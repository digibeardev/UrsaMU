# @Create

COMMAND: @Create

ATTRIBUTE: **Create**

works the same as @create <object>, but returns the database number of the object created. <cost> is the cost of making the object. <type> is the optional parameter, 'r' for rooms, 't' for things, and 'e' for exits. If no <type> is specific, then a thing will be creates by default. This is a side effect function, and should only be used when necessary.
