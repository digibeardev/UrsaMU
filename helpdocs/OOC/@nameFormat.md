# @nameformat

COMMAND: @nameformat `<object>` [=`<format>`]

By default, when an object is looked at, the object's name is shown.  And,
if you can link to the object, its flag letters and dbref are also shown.

With @nameformat, you can control exactly what is shown to people who
use 'look' while inside.  @nameformat is not used when people outside the
object look at it.
